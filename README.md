# 202020timer

This webapp was initial made for my CS50 2020 Final Project. It uses Flask as a framework with Python. It uses SQLite3 as a database . I used a bit of code from CS50 Finance and other sources online. There is also HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The 20-20-20 rule is for reducing eye strain during long periods of screen usage. The rule says that every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, you should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. The rule can help remind you that you should take frequent breaks away from the screen. The timer tool on this webapp is a timer that helps alert you when to stare at something 20 feet away and when you can use screentime. The default loadout is 20 minutes for screentime and 20 seconds for the staring interval. However you can make your own loadouts with your own perferred times. The timer keeps  going as long as you leave the window open in the background so you don't have  to worry about restarting the timer. However, you have to start the timer initially by yourself.

There is a register account feature with requirements for password and Login/Log System (Note these features heavily inspired from CS50 distribution code). There is a timer with 2 different intervals, not staring at something 20 feet away interval and staring interval. Timer repeats automatically. Although there is a default time of 20 minutes for not staring interval and 20 seconds staring interval, you can make your own loadouts at Manage Loadouts. There is also options to see all your current loadouts, delete loadouts, and update existing loadouts.
